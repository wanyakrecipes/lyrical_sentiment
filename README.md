# Music lyrics

This repo contains work on researching the effectiveness of text classification methods for the sentiment analysis of music lyrics.

The project will be using the [Genius Song Lyric](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information/data?select=song_lyrics.csv) dataset from Kaggle.

For information on work so far, please see [reports/summary.md](https://github.com/wanyakrecipes/lyrical_sentiment/blob/main/reports/summary.md)
