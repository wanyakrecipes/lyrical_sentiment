# lyrical_sentiment

This repo contains work on exploring lyrics with natural language process techniques. The repo will contain work in two areas:

1. Use text classification methods to examine lyric sentiment for songs in English.
2. Train a large language model (LLM) to generate lyrics in English.

## TODO

### Housekeeping
* Perhaps seperate notebooks into different tasks.

### Text classification 
* Analyse a sample of lyrics against the following models:
    * Zero-Shot Classification.
    * Generate a ChatGPT prompt to label the data.
    * Naive Bayes (using ChatGPT as the "labelled" data)
* Create a small sample (n=100) where you self label tracks you know, and evaluate the models against the labelled data:
    * Naive Bayes
    * Zero Shot Classification
    * Using Chat GPT
